# Hotel Data Analysis

In this project I used Excel form data about hotels dowloaded from Kaggle in order to build a visual data story using Power Bi.

## Business Request

The questions I'm trying to find answers with this project: "Is our hotel revenue growing by year?", "Should we increase our parking lot size?" and "What trends can we see in the data?"

## Contents

You can find in this respitory, the Excel file, SQL queries, the Backup file of SQL server database used generating Power Bi reports and Power Bi vizualisations in PDF and PBIX forms.

### What I did in this project:

1. Built a database in SQL
2. Analyzed and Retrieved Data with SQL
3. Connected Power BI to a Database
4. Visualized Data in Power BI
