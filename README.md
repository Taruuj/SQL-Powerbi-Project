# Hotel Data Analysis

In this project I use Excel form data about hotels in order to build a visual data story using Power Bi to answer questions like:
"Is our hotel revenue growing by year?", "Should we increase our parking lot size?" and "What trends can we see in the data?"

The project includes:

1. Building a Database in SQL
2. Analyzing and Retrieving Data with SQL
3. Connecting Power BI to a Database
4. Visualizing Data in Power BI
