# SQL guery used in connecting Power Bi with SQL.
#Creates a common table expression named "hotels" which combines the data from three tables: "dbo.['2018$']", "dbo.['2019$']" and "dbo.['2020$']".
# Selects all columns from the "hotels" CTE and performs a left join with two additional tables: "market_segment$" and "meal_cost$".

with hotels as (
select * from dbo.['2018$']
union
select * from dbo.['2019$']
union
select * from dbo.['2020$'])

Select * from hotels
left join market_segment$
on hotels.market_segment = market_segment$.market_segment
left join meal_cost$
on meal_cost$.meal = hotels.meal


# Formula used in Power Bi to create new custom column named "Revenue".

([stays_in_week_nights]+[stays_in_weekend_nights])*([adr]* (1-[discount]))
